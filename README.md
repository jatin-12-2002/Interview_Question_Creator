# Interview Question Creator using Mistral and LangChain

# Introduction

**Interview Question Creator** is a powerful tool designed to streamline and enhance interview preparation by generating **domain-specific interview questions and answers**. This application leverages AI-powered models and custom processing techniques to create comprehensive question sets across technical, theoretical, and behavioral domains. Users can upload a PDF of relevant materials, from which tailored interview questions are **generated, refined, and formatted for download**.

## Model and Prompt Engineering
This tool utilizes the **Mistral large language model** via **LangChain**, a library that simplifies working with advanced language models. The LangChain integration enables efficient pipelines for both question generation and refinement. The generated questions undergo a **refinement process using prompt engineering** to ensure they cover diverse aspects of interview readiness, from **technical knowledge to problem-solving and interpersonal skills**. The **refining prompt** technique is especially valuable here: it helps identify and enhance questions for clarity and depth by iterating on the initial question set with additional context from the input material. This approach ensures the questions are well-rounded and relevant, addressing various dimensions of interview topics effectively.

## Formatting Output
Once questions and answers are generated, they are **formatted in a DOCX file with custom styling for readability and clarity**. This includes applying **Markdown-inspired styling**, such as bullet points, headers, and bold text, to create a professional and accessible document.

## Frontend and Interaction
On the frontend, a simple and intuitive **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** interface allows users to upload PDFs, specify the number of questions, and download the final document. **JavaScript** manages user interactions, including file upload, server communication, status polling, and download link display, providing a smooth experience throughout.

## Handling Long Response Times with Redis and Celery and Deployment on AWS EC2
Since the **server has a 1-minute response timeout** and question generation can exceed this time limit, the app is designed to **handle tasks asynchronously using Celery and Redis**. **Redis** serves as both the task broker and results backend, while **Celery** enables background task management, allowing requests to be processed reliably and progress updates to be provided in real-time. Finally, the application is **deployed on an AWS EC2 instance**, providing flexibility, control, and scalability for end users who need on-demand access to the service.

### Step 2: Login to your AWS account Link.
### Step 3: Launch your EC2 Instance.
### Step 4: Configure your EC2 Instance.
```bash
Use t2.large or greater size instances only as it is a GenerativeAI using LLMs project.
```

### Step 5: Command for configuring EC2 Instance.

### INFORMATION: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt update are used to update the package index on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, but they are slightly different in terms of the tools they use and their functionality:

### Step 6: Connect your EC2 Instance and start typing the following commands

### Step 6.1: This command uses apt-get, the traditional package management tool.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 6.2: This command uses apt, a newer, more user-friendly command-line interface for the APT package management system.
```bash
sudo apt update -y
```

### Step 6.3: Install Nginx, Git and other tools
```bash
sudo apt install git nginx -y
```

### Step 6.3: Install required tools.
```bash
sudo apt install git curl unzip tar make sudo vim wget -y
```

### Step 6.4: Clone git repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jatin-12-2002/Interview_Question_Creator
```

### Step 6.5: Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Interview_Question_Creator
```

### Step 6.6: Create a .env file there.
```bash
touch .env
```

### Step 6.6: Open file in VI editor.
```bash
vi .env
```

### Step 6.7: Press insert and Mention .env variable then press esc for saving and write :wq for exit.
```bash
MISTRAL_API_KEY=""
HF_TOKEN=""
```

### Step 6.8: ### For checking the values of .env variables.
```bash
cat .env
```

### Step 6.9: For installing python and pip here is a command
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Step 6.10: install the requirements.txt. The --break-system-packages flag in pip allows to override the externally-managed-environment error and install Python packages system-wide.
```bash
pip3 install -r  requirements.txt
```
**OR**
```bash
pip3 install -r  requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

### The --break-system-packages flag in pip allows to override the externally-managed-environment error and install Python packages system-wide. pip install package_name --break-system-packages

### Step 6.11: Test the Application with Uvicorn. Verify the app is working by visiting **http://your-ec2-public-ip:8080**
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Step 6.12: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy. Set up Nginx to forward requests to Uvicorn. Open the Nginx configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

### Step 6.13: Update the Nginx configuration as follows:
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-ec2-public-ip;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
### Save and close the file

### Step 6.14: Then restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 6.15: Set Up Uvicorn as a Background Service. To keep Uvicorn as a systemd service, set up a systemd service file. Create a systemd  file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```

### Step 6.16: Update the configuration as follows:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Uvicorn instance to serve FastAPI app
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/your-repo-name
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
### Save and close the file

### Step 6.17: Start and enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start uvicorn
```
```bash
sudo systemctl enable uvicorn
```

### Step 6.18: Connect to a new terminal of same EC2 Instance. Install Redis.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

### Step 6.19: Start the Redis Server(usually done on port 6379 by default).
```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

### Step 6.20: Check if Redis is running. It should return **PONG** if everything is working fine.
```bash
redis-cli ping
```

### Step 6.21: Start the Celery Worker.
```bash
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

### Step 7: Configure your inbound rule:
1. Go inside the security
2. Click on security group
3. Configure your inbound rule with certain values
4. Port 8080 0.0.0.0/0 for anywhere traffic TCP/IP protocol
5. Port 6379 (Redis) 0.0.0.0/0 for anywhere traffic TCP/IP protocol

### Step 8: Save it and now run your application.
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Step 9 - Run the Public Port of EC2 Instance
```bash
http://your-ec2-public-ip:8080
```

### If you encounter any error like code:400 while running "https:{Public_address}:5000" then just run it with 'http' instead of 'https'.


### Check that your app is accessible through http://your-ec2-public-ip. Nginx will handle incoming requests and proxy them to Uvicorn.


### This setup makes your app production-ready by using Nginx and Uvicorn for stability, performance, and scalability. You can continue to scale by increasing Uvicorn workers or adding load balancing if traffic grows.
